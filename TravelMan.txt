Send place the solution to this technical test as a git repository and send us a link to it. Please, don’t copy a solution from Internet, we will know it! (we admit a cleaver refactor of a solution). Have a proper unit test file for the solution is a must.


Scenario  "You are a successful salesman working for a big company. You have 32 big accounts around the globe to visit on a periodic basis, and you have been assigned the project of saving money on your already dilated travel expense allowance. Given a list of your companies GPS locations, write a script that will help you find the shortest path to visit all 32 places once."    


Input file specifications    The input file will contain a listing of cities and coordinates in a tab-delimited file  The filename is named exactly "cities.txt"  Your script will assume this file is located on the same directory where the script is executed  There are no additional spaces or lines at the beginning or end of the file  The list will being in "Beijing", you must begin your route there      An example input file:

    You must submit exactly file called "solve.php" in a git repository. The maximum execution time is 15 minutes.   


 Output    


Your script's final (and only) output will be using any standard output function  Do not attempt to write to disk, only print to screen  The output must consist of a list of the 32 original cities provided in the input file "cities.txt"  These 32 cities should be ordered in the exact order in which you will visit your friends  There must be only one city name (exact spelling) per line followed by a newline delimiter (\n)  You will be judged on the total distance covered in your travels, the shorter the better  You cannot visit a city twice, and you must visit all cities   The schema for your output print should be:  Beijing \n Vladivostok\n  Dakar\n  Singapore (...)
